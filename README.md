# Portfolio project

## Introduction

This is my current portfolio project. I have made the design and built it with plain CSS, HTML and JavaScript. 
I am happy with how i have made it look like a few months ago, however i already have new ideas for the design and some additiona features.

When i improve my knowledge i always get so excited with how i can add it to my existing projects.
